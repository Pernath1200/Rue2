You cannot change the wording: <em>in fact</em> is always <em>in fact</em>, not <em>in a fact</em> or <em>in the fact</em>.</p><p>The gap in Part 2 often completes a fixed expression. You need to recognise the phrase and supply the missing word – usually a preposition, article, or small connecting word.</p><p><strong>Familiarity is the best way to get to know them.</strong> Read and notice them in context; learn them as whole phrases. See the full list of fixed phrases in the <strong>Reference</strong> section of this programme.</p>"

    {"question": "Why can't you change the words in a fixed expression?", "suggested": "Fixed expressions are conventional – native speakers use them in one form only. Changing a word (in a fact, as result) makes it wrong. They must be learned as complete units."},
    {"question": "Why is familiarity the best way to learn them?", "suggested": "You learn them by seeing and hearing them in context. Reading, practice tests, and exposure help you recognise the phrase when the gap appears. Memorising the Reference list helps too."},
    {"question": "What is the difference between <em>in time</em> and <em>on time</em>?", "suggested": "In time = with enough time to spare, before a deadline. On time = punctually, at the scheduled time. Both are fixed; the preposition cannot be swapped."},
    {"question": "Give three fixed expressions with <em>in</em> and three with <em>on</em>.", "suggested": "In: in fact, in order to, in addition, in spite of, in terms of, in case, in time. On: on the other hand, on behalf of, on the basis of, on account of."},
