    {"question": "In <em>It's ___ better now</em>, which intensifier fits before the comparative?", "options": ["more", "the", "as", "much"], "correct": 3, "explanation": "Much, far, a lot intensify comparatives. Never 'more better'."},
    {"question": "In <em>This is ___ best option</em>, which word fits before the superlative?", "options": ["more", "a", "the", "much"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "Superlatives take 'the': the best, the most important."},
    {"question": "In <em>He's as tall ___ his brother</em>, which word fits?", "options": ["than", "that", "as", "like"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "As … as – the second 'as' is required."},
    {"question": "In <em>It's the same size ___ mine</em>, which word fits?", "options": ["than", "that", "as", "like"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "The same … as. Use 'as', not 'than'."},
    {"question": "Is <em>more bigger</em> correct?", "options": ["Yes", "No – use much bigger or bigger"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Never use 'more' with -er. Use 'much bigger' or just 'bigger'."},
    {"question": "In <em>There are ___ reasons now</em>, which fits? (countable plural)", "options": ["less", "fewer", "few", "lower"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Fewer + countable plural. Less + uncountable."},
    {"question": "When comparing exactly two, we say <em>the ___ of the two</em>. Which form?", "options": ["best (superlative)", "better (comparative)", "good", "most good"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "For two things, use the comparative: the better of the two."}

  "optionalQuestionsBank": [
    {"question": "Why can't we say 'more better' or 'more bigger'?", "suggested": "We never combine 'more' with the -er form. Use 'much' + comparative (much better, much bigger), or just the comparative alone. 'More' is used with long adjectives: more expensive."},
    {"question": "Explain the difference between <em>less</em> and <em>fewer</em>.", "suggested": "Less + uncountable nouns (less time, less water). Fewer + countable plurals (fewer people, fewer reasons). 'Less reasons' is wrong; use 'fewer reasons'."},
    {"question": "When do we use <em>the better</em> instead of <em>the best</em>?", "suggested": "When comparing exactly two things: the better of the two, the more expensive of the two. With three or more, use the superlative: the best of the three."},
    {"question": "What is wrong with 'as good that'?", "suggested": "The structure is 'as … as'. Both 'as' are required. 'As good as' is correct. 'That' or 'than' cannot replace the second 'as'."},
    {"question": "Give three intensifiers that can go before a comparative.", "suggested": "Much, far, a lot, even, still. e.g. much better, far more important, even worse."}
