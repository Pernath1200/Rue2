    {"question": "Why is 'what' often misused as a relative pronoun?", "suggested": "In some languages, one word serves both roles. In English, what = 'the thing(s) that' as a unit, with no antecedent. Which/that/who refer back to a noun. The thing that I meant ✓. The thing what I meant ❌."},
    {"question": "When do we use <em>it</em> vs <em>there</em> as a subject?", "suggested": "It: dummy subject (It is important to...), or referring to something specific (It was raining). There: existence (There are many reasons, There is a problem). Never 'It are' or 'There is important'."},
    {"question": "Explain the difference between defining and non-defining relative clauses.", "suggested": "Defining: identifies which one (The book that I lent you – essential). No comma. That can replace which/who. Non-defining: extra info (This book, which I bought yesterday, is excellent). Commas. Use which/who, not that."},
    {"question": "Give three sentences where <em>what</em> is correct.", "suggested": "e.g. What I meant was clear. / I know what you mean. / What we need is time. In each case, what stands alone and means 'the thing(s) that'."},
    {"question": "When might you use <em>whose</em> for things (not just people)?", "suggested": "Whose can refer to things when we need possession: the house whose roof was damaged, the company whose profits fell. It avoids awkward 'of which' constructions."}
