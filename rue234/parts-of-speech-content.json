    {"question": "What question should you ask before choosing a word?", "options": ["What is the longest word?", "What part of speech fits here?", "What word rhymes?"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Identifying the part of speech narrows down your options and helps you find the right word quickly."},
    {"question": "In <em>I saw ___ cat</em>, the gap is most likely what?", "options": ["Preposition", "Article or determiner", "Modal verb"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The gap is before a noun (cat). Articles and determiners go before nouns."},

    {"question": "In <em>operations ___ carried out</em>, the gap is what?", "options": ["Modal", "Auxiliary verb", "Preposition"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The passive structure needs the auxiliary 'be' (are, is, was) before the past participle."},
    {"question": "Words like <em>which</em>, <em>who</em>, <em>where</em> that start a describing clause are called what?", "options": ["Prepositions", "Relative pronouns (or adverb)", "Modals"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Which, who, where introduce relative clauses. They are relative pronouns (or 'where' is a relative adverb)."},

What type of word is it?", "options": ["Conjunction", "Article", "Particle (preposition/adverb)"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "The word that completes a phrasal verb (e.g. into, out) is a particle – a preposition or adverb."},
    {"question": "Where do prepositions usually appear in relation to a verb or noun?", "options": ["Before", "After", "In the next sentence"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Prepositions usually come after the verb, noun or adjective (e.g. interested in, reason for)."}

    {"question": "In <em>I saw ___ cat</em>, what type of word goes in the gap?", "accepted": ["article", "determiner", "a", "the"], "explanation": "The gap is before a noun. Articles (a, the) and determiners go before nouns."},

    {"question": "What do we call <em>which</em>, <em>who</em>, <em>where</em> when they start a clause describing a noun?", "accepted": ["relative pronoun", "relative", "relative adverb", "relative pronouns"], "explanation": "They introduce relative clauses. Which/who/that are relative pronouns; where is a relative adverb."},
    {"question": "In a passive like <em>operations ___ carried out</em>, what type of word fills the gap?", "accepted": ["auxiliary", "auxiliary verb", "are", "be"], "explanation": "The passive needs the auxiliary 'be' (are, is, was, etc.) before the past participle."},

    {"question": "What part of speech joins two clauses (e.g. <em>___ he was tired</em>)?", "accepted": ["conjunction", "conjunctions", "although", "though"], "explanation": "Conjunctions (although, because, when, etc.) join two clauses or ideas."}

  "optionalQuestionsBank": [
    {"question": "Why is it useful to identify the part of speech before choosing a word?", "suggested": "It narrows down your options. If you need a preposition, you think of in, on, for, etc. instead of guessing randomly."},
    {"question": "Give an example sentence where the gap needs an article.", "suggested": "e.g. I saw ___ cat. / She has ___ idea. The gap is before a singular countable noun."},
    {"question": "How can you tell if a gap needs a relative pronoun?", "suggested": "There is a noun before the gap, and the words after the gap form a clause that describes that noun. e.g. an organisation ___ has 22 members."},
    {"question": "What is the difference between an auxiliary and a modal verb in a gap?", "suggested": "Auxiliaries (be, have, do) form passive, perfect, or questions. Modals (can, would, must) express ability, possibility, obligation. Both are followed by another verb form."},
    {"question": "How do you spot a gap that needs a preposition?", "suggested": "Look at the word before the gap – is it a verb, noun, or adjective that typically takes a preposition? e.g. interested + in, depends + on, reason + for."},
    {"question": "What is a phrasal verb particle?", "suggested": "The preposition or adverb that completes a phrasal verb. e.g. look into, carry out, give up. The particle changes the meaning of the verb."},
    {"question": "When might a gap need a conjunction?", "suggested": "When two clauses need to be joined. e.g. Although he was tired, he went. / I stayed home because I was ill. Look for two parts of a sentence that need linking."},
    {"question": "Give three different parts of speech that could fill a gap, with an example for each.", "suggested": "Article: a, the (before noun). Preposition: in, on (after verb/noun). Relative pronoun: which, who (before clause). Auxiliary: are, have (passive/tense). Conjunction: although, because (linking clauses)."}
