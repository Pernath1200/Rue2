They tell the reader how one idea relates to another – whether we are adding, contrasting, explaining cause and effect, or showing time order.</p><p><strong>Conjunctions</strong> typically join clauses within a sentence (<em>and</em>, <em>but</em>, <em>because</em>, <em>when</em>). <strong>Linkers</strong> (or <em>discourse markers</em>) often connect sentences or start a new sentence (<em>however</em>, <em>therefore</em>, <em>meanwhile</em>). Both serve the same purpose: they make the structure of your argument or narrative clear.</p><p>In Part 2, the gap often needs a conjunction or linker that expresses one of four essential logical relations.</p>"

    {"question": "In <em>He tried hard. ___, he failed</em>, which fits?", "options": ["Furthermore", "However", "Therefore", "First"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The second clause contrasts with the first – use however (followed by a comma when it starts a sentence)."},
