    {"question": "In <em>Never ___ I seen such a thing</em>, which auxiliary fits?", "options": ["do", "have", "did", "was"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Never have I seen – perfect tense, use 'have'."},
    {"question": "In <em>Not only ___ he leave, but he also took the keys</em>, which auxiliary fits?", "options": ["have", "has", "did", "had"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "Present/past simple needs do/does/did. 'Leave' is base form → did."},
    {"question": "In <em>Hardly had she arrived ___ the phone rang</em>, which word fits?", "options": ["than", "when", "that", "then"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Hardly … when. No sooner … than."},
    {"question": "In <em>No sooner had he left ___ it began to rain</em>, which word fits?", "options": ["when", "than", "that", "then"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "No sooner … than. Hardly … when."},
    {"question": "In <em>Rarely ___ we see such behaviour</em>, which auxiliary fits?", "options": ["have", "had", "do", "did"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "Present simple → add 'do'. Rarely do we see."},
    {"question": "In <em>Under no circumstances ___ you go</em>, which auxiliary fits?", "options": ["do", "did", "should", "have"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "With modals, the modal inverts. Under no circumstances should you go."},
    {"question": "In <em>Only when he left ___ I realise</em>, which auxiliary fits?", "options": ["have", "had", "do", "did"], "correct": 3, "explanation": "Past simple in main clause → did. Only when he left did I realise."}

  "optionalQuestionsBank": [
    {"question": "Why do we invert after words like 'never' and 'not only'?", "suggested": "Inversion adds emphasis and is required in formal/written English when these words begin the sentence. The structure mirrors a question: auxiliary + subject."},
    {"question": "When do we use 'have' vs 'do' in inverted structures?", "suggested": "Use have/has/had when the meaning is perfect (have seen, had arrived). Use do/does/did when the main verb is present or past simple (did leave, do see)."},
    {"question": "What is the difference between 'hardly … when' and 'no sooner … than'?", "suggested": "Both mean 'as soon as'. Hardly/scarcely pairs with 'when'. No sooner pairs with 'than'. Hardly had she arrived when ... / No sooner had he left than ..."},
    {"question": "In 'Only when he left did I realise', why is it 'did I realise' not 'I realised'?", "suggested": "When 'only when' (or only then, only after) starts the sentence, the main clause must invert. Past simple needs 'did' + base form: did I realise."},
    {"question": "Give three negative or restrictive expressions that trigger inversion.", "suggested": "e.g. Never, Not only, Hardly, Rarely, Seldom, Under no circumstances, No sooner, Only when, Little did I know."}
