      "title": "What are phrasal verbs?",
      "body": "<p><strong>Phrasal verbs</strong> are <strong>multi-word verbs</strong>: a main verb + one or two <strong>particles</strong>. The particle is a preposition or adverb that attaches to the verb. Together they form a single unit with a meaning that often differs from the verb alone.</p><p>Examples: <em>look</em> + <em>into</em> = investigate; <em>give</em> + <em>up</em> = stop trying; <em>look</em> + <em>forward</em> + <em>to</em> = anticipate.</p><p>The particle gives a clue to the meaning – it functions a bit like a prefix (e.g. <em>up</em> often suggests completion; <em>out</em> can suggest distribution or removal). But each phrasal verb must be learned as a whole; the particle is fixed for that meaning.</p>"

    {
      "title": "Types of phrasal verbs",
      "body": "<p><strong>Transitive vs intransitive:</strong> Some phrasal verbs take an object (<em>carry out</em> a survey), others do not (<em>give up</em> – we give up something, but <em>the engine gave up</em> needs no object).</p><p><strong>Separable vs inseparable:</strong> With some transitive phrasal verbs, the object can go between the verb and the particle (<em>turn off the light</em> = <em>turn the light off</em>). With others, the particle must stay next to the verb (<em>look into</em> the matter – not <em>look the matter into</em>).</p><p><strong>Two particles:</strong> Some phrasal verbs have two particles: <em>look forward to</em>, <em>put up with</em>, <em>get away with</em>.</p>"

But the exact meaning depends on the verb – learn each phrasal verb as a unit.</p>"

    {"question": "Why is it important to look at the verb before the gap when guessing a phrasal verb particle?", "suggested": "The particle is fixed for each phrasal verb. The verb tells you which phrasal verb is needed; the surrounding words (object, context) tell you the meaning and thus which particle fits."},

    {"question": "In <em>put ___ the meeting</em> (postpone), which particle fits? Why?", "suggested": "Put off. Put off = postpone, delay. The particle is fixed for this meaning."},
