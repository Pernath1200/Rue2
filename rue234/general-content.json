  "mcQuiz": [
    {"question": "How many words do you write in each gap?", "options": ["One word", "One or two words", "Up to three words"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Each gap needs exactly one word. Contractions like don't count as two words (do + not), so they are not allowed."},
    {"question": "How many gaps are there in the text?", "options": ["Six", "Seven", "Eight"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "Part 2 always has eight gaps. This is a fixed format."},
    {"question": "Do contractions like <em>don't</em> count as one word?", "options": ["Yes", "No"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Contractions are two words combined (don't = do + not). You can only write one word per gap, so contractions don't fit."},
    {"question": "What should you do before choosing your word?", "options": ["Read only the gap", "Read the whole sentence and paragraph", "Guess quickly"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Context matters. The words around the gap tell you what part of speech and meaning you need. Always read the full sentence and paragraph."},
    {"question": "Must your spelling be correct?", "options": ["No", "Yes"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Wrong spelling = wrong answer. The word must be spelled correctly to be marked correct."},
    {"question": "Words like <em>a</em>, <em>the</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>on</em> are mainly what type?", "options": ["Content words", "Grammar words", "Long words"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "These small words hold the sentence together and show grammar relationships. Content words (nouns, main verbs) carry the main meaning."},
    {"question": "Which question helps you find the right word?", "options": ["What is the longest word?", "What part of speech fits here?", "What word rhymes?"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Identifying the part of speech (article, preposition, etc.) narrows down the options and helps you find the right word."}

  "shortQuestions": [
    {"question": "What is the maximum number of words you can write in one gap?", "accepted": ["one", "1"], "explanation": "Exactly one word per gap. No contractions (they count as two words)."},
    {"question": "How many gaps are there in a Part 2 text?", "accepted": ["eight", "8"], "explanation": "Part 2 always has eight gaps. This is the standard format."},
    {"question": "Name one type of grammar word that often fills a gap.", "accepted": ["article", "pronoun", "preposition", "conjunction", "auxiliary", "modal", "determiner"], "explanation": "Part 2 mainly tests grammar words (articles, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, auxiliaries, modals) rather than content words."},
    {"question": "Give an example of a fixed phrase (e.g. in order ___).", "accepted": ["in order to", "in fact", "such as", "in spite of", "on the other hand", "by means of"], "explanation": "Fixed phrases are set expressions. The gap completes the phrase (e.g. in order to, such as, in spite of)."},
    {"question": "Does <em>don't</em> count as one word or two?", "accepted": ["two", "2"], "explanation": "Don't = do + not, so it counts as two words. One word per gap only."},
    {"question": "Should you read only the gap or the whole sentence?", "accepted": ["whole sentence", "the whole sentence", "whole", "sentence", "paragraph"], "explanation": "Reading the whole sentence and paragraph gives you the context you need to choose the right word."},
    {"question": "What is Part 2 called?", "accepted": ["open cloze", "cloze", "the open cloze"], "explanation": "'Open' means you are not given a list of words – you must think of the word yourself. 'Cloze' means gaps in the text."}

  "optionalQuestionsBank": [
    {"question": "Explain why reading the whole sentence helps you find the right word.", "suggested": "The context shows what the sentence is about, what comes before and after the gap, and what part of speech or phrase is needed."},
    {"question": "Give three examples of grammar words that might fill a gap.", "suggested": "e.g. <em>a</em>, <em>the</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>which</em>, <em>are</em>, <em>can</em>, <em>although</em>."},
    {"question": "What is the difference between a grammar word and a content word in Part 2?", "suggested": "Grammar words (articles, prepositions, etc.) hold the sentence together. Content words (nouns, main verbs) carry the main meaning. Part 2 usually tests grammar words."},
    {"question": "Why can't you use a contraction like <em>won't</em> to fill one gap?", "suggested": "Contractions = two words (e.g. will + not). You can only write one word per gap."},
    {"question": "How does knowing the part of speech help you choose the right word?", "suggested": "If you know you need a preposition, you narrow down the options (in, on, for, etc.). Same for pronoun, article, etc."},
    {"question": "List three fixed phrases that often appear in open cloze texts.", "suggested": "e.g. in order to, such as, in spite of, on the other hand, by means of, in fact."},
    {"question": "What should you check before writing your answer in the gap?", "suggested": "Context, part of speech, spelling, and whether a fixed phrase is involved."},
    {"question": "Why is spelling important in Part 2?", "suggested": "Wrong spelling = wrong answer. The word must be spelled correctly to be marked correct."},
    {"question": "What types of words are <em>which</em>, <em>who</em> and <em>where</em> when they introduce a clause?", "suggested": "Relative pronouns (which, who) or relative adverb (where). They start a relative clause."},
    {"question": "Give two tips for doing well in Part 2.", "suggested": "1) Read the whole sentence. 2) Ask: what part of speech fits here? 3) Learn fixed phrases. 4) Check spelling."}
