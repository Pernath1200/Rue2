  "mcQuiz": [
    {"question": "What do auxiliary verbs do?", "options": ["Replace the main verb", "Help form tense, passive, questions and negatives", "Stand alone as the main verb"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Auxiliaries work with the main verb to form tense, passive voice, questions, and negatives."},
    {"question": "In <em>operations ___ carried out</em>, which auxiliary fits?", "options": ["do", "have", "are"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "Passive needs 'be' + past participle. 'Operations' is plural, present → are."},
    {"question": "Which auxiliary do we use for questions in present simple (e.g. ___ you know)?", "options": ["be", "have", "do"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "Present simple questions use do/does: Do you know? Does he know?"},
    {"question": "Modal verbs are followed by what?", "options": ["to + infinitive", "bare infinitive (no to)", "ing form"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Modals take the bare infinitive: can go, should book, must leave (not to go)."},
    {"question": "Do modal verbs add -s in third person?", "options": ["Yes", "No"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Modals don't change: he can, she must, it would (never cans, musts)."},
    {"question": "In <em>they ___ finished</em>, which auxiliary fits?", "options": ["are", "do", "have"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "Present perfect = have/has + past participle. They have finished."},
    {"question": "Which auxiliary forms the passive?", "options": ["do", "have", "be"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "Passive = be + past participle. The auxiliary 'be' changes form (is, are, was, were, been)."}

  "shortQuestions": [
    {"question": "Name the three primary auxiliaries.", "accepted": ["be", "have", "do", "be have do"], "explanation": "Primary auxiliaries are be, have, and do. They form tense, passive, questions, and negatives."},
    {"question": "In a passive like <em>operations ___ carried out</em>, what type of word fills the gap?", "accepted": ["auxiliary", "be", "are", "auxiliary verb"], "explanation": "Passive needs the auxiliary be. Here, 'are' (plural, present) fits."},
    {"question": "Which auxiliary do we use for present simple questions?", "accepted": ["do", "does", "do or does"], "explanation": "Present simple questions use do (I/you/we/they) or does (he/she/it)."},
    {"question": "What form of verb follows a modal (e.g. can ___, should ___)?", "accepted": ["bare infinitive", "infinitive", "base form"], "explanation": "Modals take the bare infinitive: can go, should book (no 'to')."},
    {"question": "Does <em>he can</em> or <em>he cans</em> take -s?", "accepted": ["he can", "no", "he can", "can"], "explanation": "Modal verbs don't add -s. We say 'he can', not 'he cans'."},
    {"question": "Which auxiliary forms the perfect tenses?", "accepted": ["have", "has", "had", "have has had"], "explanation": "Have, has, had form present perfect and past perfect."},
    {"question": "In <em>the work ___ done yesterday</em> (passive, past), which word fits?", "accepted": ["was"], "explanation": "Passive past singular: be (was) + past participle. The work was done."}
  ],
  "optionalQuestionsBank": [
    {"question": "Why must the passive auxiliary match the subject and tense?", "suggested": "The verb must agree with the subject (operations are, the work was). The tense must fit the context (present, past, etc.)."},
    {"question": "When do we use do/does/did as an auxiliary?", "suggested": "In present simple and past simple: for questions (Do you know?), negatives (She doesn't like it), and emphasis. We don't use do with other auxiliaries or with be/have (when have = possession)."},
    {"question": "Give two examples of gaps that need a modal verb.", "suggested": "e.g. you should book early, it would not be possible, they may have left, he can swim."},
    {"question": "What is the difference between <em>must</em> and <em>have to</em>?", "suggested": "Must often expresses obligation from the speaker (I must go). Have to often expresses external rules (You have to wear a seatbelt). Both can fill similar gaps. Have to has forms: has to, had to."},
    {"question": "How do you spot a gap that needs the auxiliary be?", "suggested": "Look for: 1) passive (noun + gap + past participle: operations ___ carried out). 2) Continuous (subject + gap + -ing: she ___ working). The form must match subject and tense."},
    {"question": "Why don't we say 'he cans' or 'she musts'?", "suggested": "Modal verbs don't take -s in the third person. Can, could, would, will, must, should, may, might are invariable."},
    {"question": "What auxiliary fits in <em>___ you been here before</em>?", "suggested": "Have. Present perfect question: Have you been...? (Have before the subject.)."},
    {"question": "Explain the structure of a passive sentence.", "suggested": "Subject + be (in correct form) + past participle. e.g. The letter was written. Operations are carried out. It has been done. The auxiliary be agrees with the subject and shows the tense."}
